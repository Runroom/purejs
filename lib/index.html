        <h1>Runroom utility kit</h1>
        <h2>Seventeen thousand!</h2>
        <p>Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll
            have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes,
            Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too
            late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every
            bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the
            money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...</p>
        <p>The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done
            with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
            If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those
            plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform
            Lord Vader we have a prisoner.</p>
        <p>All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red
            Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position.
            We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front!</p>

        <h2 id="Section1">You can't possibly... You would prefer another target?</h2>
        <p>Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll
            be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen
            to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have
            no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I
            grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
        <p>This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo.
            I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
            Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's
            the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local
            bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's
            the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local
            trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.</p>
        <p>You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
            I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting
            too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I
            hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking.
            Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?</p>
        <p>Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried
            out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your
            exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone
            thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made
            a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody
            worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they
            lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee
            win.
        </p>
        <p>The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are
            designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
            Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't
            consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans
            provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.</p>
        <p>Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. But
            I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... You can waste time with your friends when
            your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red,
            let's go. Uncle Owen... Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on us? Excuse
            me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen... Yeah? What about that one? What
            about that blue one? We'll take that one. Yeah, take it away.</p>
        <p>Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another
            drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.</p>
        <p>Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you
            think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you
            think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!</p>
        <p>Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader,
            this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going
            to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This
            is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.</p>
        <p>Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has
            been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied!
            She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!</p>
        <p>You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have
            time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for
            the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.
            Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit
            the planet.</p>
        <p>And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.</p>

        <h2 id="Section2">All flight trooper, man your stations</h2>
        <p>All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah!
            I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough
            to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come
            on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use
            a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.</p>
        <p>They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along
            a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up
            that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas...
            Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think...
        </p>
        <p>Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is
            Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold
            up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your
            eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No
            sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them
            off for a few seconds.</p>
        <p>Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked
            with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for
            you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad
            case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out
            of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or
            teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
            Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.</p>
        <p>I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before!
            Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll
            have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell
            twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What
            happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're
            all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak
            here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating
            number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!</p>
        <p>Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification.
            These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business.
            You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.</p>
        <p>Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as
            luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks
            like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good.
            You have taken your first step into a larger world.</p>
        <p>We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized
            your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing
            the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess
            Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station
            operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more
            star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

        <h2 id="Section3">They're madmen!</h2>
        <p>Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might
            catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart
            here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right.</p>
        <p>What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who
            has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block
            A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you
            talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't
            get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you
            just find a way back into the detention block?</p>
        <p>What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
            It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't
            it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.</p>
        <p>All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders
            there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I
            think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I
            do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring.</p>
        <p>What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got
            it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry
            aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast
            'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.</p>
        <p>Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!!
            Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just
            stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could
            he be?</p>
        <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him.
            He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's
            me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't
            seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily
            startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
            Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go
            on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind
            of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move.</p>

        <h2 id="Section4">They're madmen! Section 4</h2>
